# Fract-llustrator
A simple Python script that draws a Sierpinski Triangle in green using a recursive algorithm that utilizes the white space in the background. It uses the Turtle module. I developed this when I had no knowledge of recursion, and so I figured it out as I went. According to Wikipedia, another recursive algorithm is more commonly used to generate the fractal.
